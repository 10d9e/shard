# MPCNet: Decentralized Threshold Network using Shamir's Secret Sharing

MPCNet is a decentralized application built to facilitate secure and robust threshold networking using Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) and proactive secret refreshing. It allows users to split secrets into shares, distribute them across a network, combine them to reconstruct the original secret, and refresh these shares to maintain security over time.

## Overview of Shamir's Secret Sharing and Proactive Refresh

### Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS)

Shamir's Secret Sharing is a cryptographic technique developed by Adi Shamir. It enables a secret to be divided into multiple shares, distributed to participants, such that only a specified number of shares (threshold) can reconstruct the original secret. This approach ensures that the secret is secure even if some shares are compromised.

#### Mathematical Foundation

The secret sharing is based on polynomial interpolation in finite fields. The process involves:

1. Choosing a random polynomial of degree `t-1`, where `t` is the threshold.
2. Setting the constant term of the polynomial as the secret.
3. Generating shares as points on the polynomial.

The secret can be reconstructed by interpolating the polynomial using any `t` shares.

### Proactive Secret Sharing

Proactive secret sharing extends the security of SSS by periodically refreshing shares without altering the secret. It mitigates the risk of long-term attacks and ensures the durability of the secret's confidentiality.

## MPCNet Functionalities

MPCNet provides various functionalities as part of its command-line interface:

### 1. `provide`

Run MPCNet as a share provider. This mode enables the node to store and manage secret shares.

```bash
mpcnet provide [OPTIONS]
```

### 2. `combine`

Combine shares to reconstruct the original secret. This command requires specifying the key associated with the shares and the threshold number.

```bash
mpcnet combine --key <KEY> --threshold <THRESHOLD>
```

### 3. `split`

Split a secret into shares and register them with the network. This command allows specifying the threshold, total number of shares, and the secret to split.

```bash
mpcnet split --threshold <THRESHOLD> --shares <SHARES> --secret <SECRET>
```

### 4. `ls`

List the providers for a specific share. This command helps in identifying all the nodes that hold a share of a particular secret.

```bash
mpcnet ls
```

### 5. `refresh`

Refresh the shares to enhance their security. This command requires the key associated with the shares, the share threshold, and the key size.

```bash
mpcnet refresh --key <KEY> --threshold <THRESHOLD> --size <SIZE>
```



## Getting Started with MPCNet

To use MPCNet, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Compile and install MPCNet from the source code.
2. **Running a Node**: Start an MPCNet node using the `provide` command.
3. **Splitting a Secret**: Use the `split` command to divide a secret into shares.
4. **Combining Shares**: Reconstruct the secret using the `combine` command with the required number of shares.
5. **Refreshing Shares**: Regularly refresh shares using the `refresh` command to maintain security.

MPCNet is a versatile tool for managing secrets in a distributed and decentralized environment, leveraging the robustness of Shamir's Secret Sharing and proactive share refreshing.

### Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS)

#### Mathematical Foundation

1. **Polynomial Construction**:
   The core idea of SSS is based on constructing a polynomial of degree `t-1` (where `t` is the threshold number of shares needed to reconstruct the secret) over a finite field (typically GF(2^8) or GF(256) for 256 distinct values).

   The polynomial is defined as:
   \[ f(x) = a_0 + a_1 \cdot x + a_2 \cdot x^2 + \cdots + a_{t-1} \cdot x^{t-1} \]

   where:
   - \( a_0 \) is the secret to be shared.
   - \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{t-1} \) are coefficients chosen randomly from the finite field, except for \( a_0 \).

2. **Share Generation**:
   Shares are generated by evaluating this polynomial at different points. Each share is a tuple \( (x, f(x)) \), where \( x \) is a non-zero element of the field, and \( f(x) \) is the polynomial's value at \( x \).

3. **Secret Reconstruction**:
   The secret \( a_0 \) (the constant term of the polynomial) can be reconstructed using any \( t \) shares by interpolating the polynomial using Lagrange interpolation.

   The Lagrange interpolation formula in a finite field is:
   \[ f(0) = \sum_{j=1}^{t} y_j \cdot \prod_{\substack{1 \leq m \leq t \\ m \neq j}} \frac{x_m}{x_m - x_j} \]

   where \( (x_j, y_j) \) are the shares used for reconstruction.

### Proactive Secret Refreshing

Proactive secret sharing involves periodically updating the shares without changing the original secret. This is achieved by:

1. **Creating a New Polynomial**:
   A new polynomial is generated with the same constant term (the secret) but with different random coefficients for the other terms.

2. **Refreshing Shares**:
   The existing shares are updated by adding values derived from the new polynomial. The process ensures that the shares remain valid for the original secret but are different from the previous shares.

### Example: Using SSS and Proactive Refresh in MPCNet

1. **Splitting a Secret (SSS)**:
   Suppose you have a secret number `123`, and you want to split it into shares with a threshold of `3`. You would create a polynomial of degree `2` (threshold - 1) with `123` as the constant term. Random coefficients are chosen for the other terms. Shares are then generated by evaluating this polynomial at different points.

2. **Refreshing Shares**:
   After some time, to refresh these shares, you generate a new polynomial with `123` as the constant term again but with new random coefficients for the other terms. The shares are updated by adding values from this new polynomial, thus refreshing them without altering the original secret.

### Conclusion

In summary, Shamir's Secret Sharing is a powerful and mathematically robust method for distributing a secret among a group of participants. Proactive secret refreshing enhances the security of this method by periodically updating the shares, making it highly suitable for secure and decentralized applications like MPCNet.
